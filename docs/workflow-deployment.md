# Workflow deployment guide

The bundled [`data-pipeline-alert-enrichment.yaml`](../workflows/data-pipeline-alert-enrichment.yaml) is a Kibana **Workflow** that runs when any data-pipeline alerting rule fires. It enriches the alert with ServiceNow CMDB context (CI owner, support group, open incidents, recent changes), opens a Kibana case when multiple incidents are found, emails the on-call group, and indexes the enriched record back to Elasticsearch.

This page documents how to install and run it on each Elastic deployment type.

## Deployment compatibility

| Deployment                                            | Workflows plugin | `elastic-cloud-email` connector                                        | Out-of-the-box?                |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Elastic Cloud Hosted (ESS)**                        | GA               | Auto-provisioned                                                       | Yes                            |
| **Elastic Cloud Serverless** (Observability/Security) | Preview          | Auto-provisioned (id `elastic-cloud-email`, name `Elastic-Cloud-SMTP`) | Yes                            |
| **Self-hosted** (Stack 9.3+, ECE, ECK)                | Preview from 9.3 | Not provisioned                                                        | Requires extra connector setup |

### Required licences

| Feature                                 | Licence                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workflows plugin                        | **Enterprise**                                                               |
| Cases (`kibana.createCaseDefaultSpace`) | **Platinum** or higher (included in Observability / Security solution tiers) |
| Email / Slack / Teams / etc. connectors | All Stack tiers; specific webhook actions may require Gold+                  |

On Elastic Cloud Hosted and Serverless these tiers are bundled by default for projects with the Observability or Security solution. On self-hosted, your subscription must include them.

### Kibana sizing

Workflows is memory-hungry — Elastic raised the default Kibana instance size on Elastic Cloud Hosted to **2 GB RAM** in 9.4 specifically because Workflows, Reporting, Detection Rules and Agent Builder can cause service interruptions on smaller instances. We recommend the same minimum on self-hosted, ECE and ECK clusters that run this workflow.

### Enabling Workflows on self-hosted

Workflows is preview on self-hosted from 9.3 and is **off by default**. Enable it through:

```
Stack Management → Advanced Settings → workflows:ui:enabled = true
```

Equivalent API call:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$KIBANA_URL/api/kibana/settings" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY" \
  -H "kbn-xsrf: true" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"changes":{"workflows:ui:enabled":true}}'
```

## Inputs

The workflow exposes three inputs you can override at install time. Defaults are picked so the workflow runs unchanged on Elastic Cloud Hosted and Serverless.

| Input            | Default                            | Used by                                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `emailConnector` | `elastic-cloud-email`              | The active `notify_email` step                       |
| `notifyTo`       | `data-platform-oncall@example.com` | Recipient of `notify_email`                          |
| `slackConnector` | `data-pipeline-alerts`             | Optional — only used if you uncomment `notify_slack` |

## Install paths

There are three ways to install the workflow. They all produce the same end
state — the Setup wizard and the CLI use the Workflows REST API; the manual
path is for clusters where the API is unavailable or where you'd rather paste
the YAML by hand.

| Path                                                          | Best for                                            | Notes                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Setup wizard** (Setup page → Alert-enrichment Workflow row) | Most users — visual install, idempotent reinstall   | Auto-detects 9.4+ to pick the right cases step, exposes `notifyTo` / `emailConnector` text fields, pre-flights the connector. Mirrors the CLI exactly.                           |
| **CLI** (`npm run setup:workflow`)                            | Headless / CI installs                              | Same overrides and 9.4 auto-detect as the wizard. Interactive prompts for URL, API key, deployment type, and inputs.                                                              |
| **Manual paste**                                              | Workflows API blocked, or you want to edit pre-save | Copy [`assets/workflows/data-pipeline-alert-enrichment.yaml`](../assets/workflows/data-pipeline-alert-enrichment.yaml) into Stack Management → Workflows → Create. Override `notifyTo` and `emailConnector` in the form before saving. |

## Setup per deployment type

### Elastic Cloud Hosted

1. Confirm the Workflows app is visible under the navigation. (Cloud Hosted enables it automatically on supported tiers.)
2. Either run the Setup wizard / `npm run setup:workflow`, or paste [`assets/workflows/data-pipeline-alert-enrichment.yaml`](../assets/workflows/data-pipeline-alert-enrichment.yaml) into **Stack Management → Workflows → Create** and override `notifyTo` if you want a different recipient than the default placeholder.
3. Done. The workflow will fire on the next data-pipeline alert.

### Elastic Cloud Serverless

1. Workflows is a preview feature — confirm your project type (Observability or Security) shows the Workflows app.
2. Same install path as Cloud Hosted: wizard, CLI, or manual paste. The `elastic-cloud-email` connector ID resolves automatically.

### Self-hosted (Stack 9.3+, ECE, ECK)

The default `elastic-cloud-email` connector does **not** exist on self-hosted deployments — Elastic's control plane provisions it only on Cloud-managed clusters. You have two options:

#### Option A — Preconfigure in `kibana.yml` (recommended)

Add an entry that uses the same `elastic-cloud-email` ID so the workflow runs unchanged:

```yaml
xpack.actions.preconfigured:
  elastic-cloud-email:
    name: SMTP
    actionTypeId: .email
    config:
      service: other
      from: alerts@example.com
      host: smtp.example.com
      port: 587
      hasAuth: true
    secrets:
      user: smtp-user
      password: smtp-password
```

Restart Kibana, install the workflow, override `notifyTo` if desired.

#### Option B — Bring your own connector ID

1. Create an email connector via **Stack Management → Connectors** (or the Actions API). Note its connector ID.
2. When installing the workflow, override the `emailConnector` input:

   ```yaml
   inputs:
     emailConnector: my-smtp-connector-id
     notifyTo: oncall@example.com
   ```

3. Save. The workflow now points at your connector.

## Switching to a different channel

The workflow ships with six commented-out alternatives directly below the active `notify_email` step:

- `notify_slack` (Slack — `.slack` or `.slack_api`)
- `notify_teams` (Microsoft Teams incoming webhook)
- `notify_pagerduty` (PagerDuty)
- `notify_servicenow` (ServiceNow ITSM — creates an incident)
- `notify_opsgenie` (Opsgenie)
- `notify_webhook` (generic webhook)

Each block reuses the same enriched-alert template. To switch channels, comment out the email step and uncomment one (or several) alternatives. They run sequentially; wrap them in a `parallel` step if you need concurrent fan-out. Each requires a connector you've already configured under **Kibana → Stack Management → Connectors**.

## Pre-flight connector validation

The first step the workflow runs is `validate_email_connector`, a `kibana.request` step that GETs `/api/actions/connector/{{ inputs.emailConnector }}`. If the connector ID resolves, the workflow continues; if it doesn't, the run aborts immediately with a single clear error rather than silently burning retries inside `notify_email`.

Common outcomes:

- **200 OK** — connector exists; workflow continues to alert handling.
- **404 Not Found** — connector ID is wrong or the connector hasn't been created on this deployment. Run history will surface the failed step as the abort cause. Fix:
  - Cloud Hosted / Serverless: confirm `elastic-cloud-email` exists under **Stack Management → Connectors** (it should be auto-provisioned).
  - Self-hosted: apply Option A or Option B above.
- **403 Forbidden** — the workflow's runtime token lacks `read` on the action. Grant Kibana **Actions and Connectors** read privileges to the workflow's role.

## Stack 9.4+ enhancements

These are optional ergonomic improvements you can adopt once the cluster is on 9.4. The workflow runs unchanged on 9.3 — none of these are required.

| Feature                                                                                                                                            | What it gives you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **First-class cases steps** — `cases.createCase`, `cases.updateCase`, `cases.getCase`, `cases.addComment`                                          | Drop-in replacement for the `kibana.createCaseDefaultSpace` step in section 7. No more required `connector` / `settings` block, and an opt-in `push-case: true` flag automatically pushes the case to an attached Jira / ServiceNow ITSM connector. The bundled YAML keeps the legacy step for 9.3 compatibility but ships the 9.4 alternative as a commented block immediately below it. |
| **`workflows.executionFailed` trigger**                                                                                                            | Lets you create a sister workflow that fires whenever this one fails. Handy for fallback notifications (e.g. SMS / pager) when the primary email channel is degraded.                                                                                   |
| **Server-side workflow validation endpoint** (`POST /api/workflows/_workflows/_validate`)                                                          | Gate this YAML in CI before deploy so a typo never reaches a running cluster. Pair with the workflow's import / export endpoints below for full GitOps.                                                                                                  |
| **Workflow import / export from the UI**                                                                                                           | Promote workflows between spaces (or between Cloud → Serverless) without copy-pasting YAML. Useful for staging → production rollouts.                                                                                                                    |
| **Streams API steps**                                                                                                                              | Reach Streams resources directly without going through `kibana.request`. Not required by this workflow today, but worth knowing if you extend it.                                                                                                        |

## Triggering the workflow

The workflow's trigger is `type: alert`, which means it fires whenever a Kibana **alerting rule** sends it the alert payload. The bundled data-pipeline alerting rules (installed by the Setup wizard or `npm run setup:alert-rules`) are pre-wired to send their payload to this workflow when one is registered. If you install the workflow before installing the alerting rules, no extra wiring is needed.

You can also test the workflow manually:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$KIBANA_URL/api/workflows/_workflows/<workflow-id>/run" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY" \
  -H "kbn-xsrf: true" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event":{"alerts":[{"kibana":{"alert":{"rule":{"name":"[CloudLoadGen] Pipeline Failure"}}}, "message":"Manual test"}]}}'
```
